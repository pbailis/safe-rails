\begin{abstract} The rise of Web 2.0 internet services has led to a range of popular new programming frameworks. In this work, we examine one such framework---Ruby on Rails---and its use and abuse of database concurrency control mechanisms. Namely, Rails programmers eschew the use of traditional transaction-oriented programming in lieu of application-level mechanisms including declarative validations and associations. In this work, we examine the implications of this decision for both applications and database systems. We quantitatively analyze the use of these mechanisms in a range of open source projects and determine which actually ensure integrity---and which of these feral, application-level mechanisms may lead to data corruption, demonstrating actual integrity violations when this is the case. We present recommendations for database system designers for reducing and eliminating these integrity violations. \end{abstract}
