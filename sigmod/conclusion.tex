\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we examined the use of concurrency control mechanisms in
a set of 67 open source Ruby on Rails applications and, to a less
thorough extent, concurrency control support in a range of other web
frameworks. We found that, in contrast with traditional transaction
processing, these applications overwhelmingly prefer to leverage
application-level \textit{feral} support for data integrity, typically
in the form of declarative (sometimes user-defined) validation and
association logic. Despite the popularity of these validations, we
find limited use of in-database support to correctly implement them,
leading to a range of quantifiable inconsistencies for Rails' built-in
uniqueness and association validations. While indeed many validations
are invariant confluent and therefore correct under concurrent
execution given standard RDBMS weak isolation and concurrent update
semantics, we see considerable opportunity to better support these
users and their feral validations in the future.
