\section{Other ORMs}

While our focus in this paper is on Rails, we briefly investigated the
incidence of (problematic, in Rails) uniqueness and foreign key
constraints in several other frameworks.

\newcommand{\orm}[1]{{\vspace{.45em}\noindent\textit{#1}}}

\orm{Java Persistence API}
(JPA; version EE 7)\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html}}
is a standard Java Object persistence interface and supports both
uniqueness and primary key constraints in the database via specialized
object annotations. Thus, when JPA is used to create a table, it will
use the database to enforce these constraints. In 2009, JPA introduced
support for UDF validations via a JavaBean interface.\footnote{Most
  recent update: \url{https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=349}} Interestingly,
the Bean validation proposal specifically addresses the use of
uniqueness validations:
\begin{quote}
``Question: should we add @Unique that would map to @Column(unique=true)?
@Unique cannot be tested at the Java level reliably but could generate
a database unique constraint generation. @Unique is not part
of the BV spec today.''~\cite{jsr-bean}
\end{quote}
An author of some of the code specification notes on a separate blog
post:
\begin{quote}
  ``The reason @Unique is not part of the built-in constraints is the
  fact that accessing the Session/EntityManager during a valiation
  [sic] is opening yourself up for potenital phantom reads. Think
  twice before you go for [a UDF-based] approach.''~\cite{unique-bean}
\end{quote}

\orm{Hibernate} (version 4.3.5), a Java ORM based on JPA, does
not automatically back declared relationships. For uniqueness and
foreign key constraints, it relies on JPA annotations for
correctness. However, it also has an extensive user-level validation
framework.\footnote{\url{http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html/}}

\orm{CakePHP} (version 2.5.5), a PHP-based web
framework,\footnote{\url{http://cakephp.org/}} supports uniqueness,
foreign key, and UDF validations via user-level checks. It does not
back any of its validation checking with a database transaction and
relies on the user to correctly specify the schema.

\orm{Django} (version 1.7), a popular Python-based
framework,\footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}} backs declared
uniqueness and foreign key constraints with database-level
invariants. It also supports custom validations.

\orm{Laravel} (version 4.2), another PHP-based web framework,\footnote{\url{http://laravel.com/}} supports the same
set of functionality as CakePHP. Any database-backed constraints must
be specified manually in the schema. The authors note that
``database-level validations can efficiently handle some things (such
as uniqueness of a column in heavily-used tables) that can be
difficult to implement otherwise...The other big downside to this
approach is that your validations would be database- and
schema-specific, which makes migrations or switching to another
database backend more difficult in the future.''

\orm{Waterline} (version 0.10), a persistence layer for
node.js\footnote{\url{https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline}} (backing
Sails.js, a popular MVC
framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/balderdashy/sails}}),
provides support for in-DB foreign key and uniqueness constraints
where supported. We found several reports of bugs in early support of
uniqueness
constraints\footnote{\url{https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo/issues/152}
  \url{https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/issues/55}
  \url{https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/issues/236}}.

\minihead{Summary} The use of validations appears to be common
practice; the inclusion of validations in (and associated review
processes associated with) a mature, Enterprise-grade programming
environment as Java EE suggests that, in fact, users appreciate
domain-specific validation. The care with which validations are
applied, however, is domain-dependent. While the Java EE developers
appear familiar with database anomalies, as we have seen, their more
lackadaisical Rails implementation can cause serious issues. While
frameworks such as Django indeed follow suit, enforcing constraints in
the database as appropriate, it is surprising to see both PHP-based
frameworks rely on the user to declare in-database constraints
\textit{while still} supporting totally feral application-level
constraints. This again suggests an enforcement strategy similar to
that of Rails. However, while Rails automatically generates schemas,
the onus in these frameworks is potentially greater on the end-user as
she is responsible for ultimately declaring schema migrations.

'''
If True, this field must be unique throughout the table.

This is enforced at the database level and by model validation. If you try to save a model with a duplicate value in a unique field, a django.db.IntegrityError will be raised by the model’s save() method.

This option is valid on all field types except ManyToManyField, OneToOneField, and FileField.

Note that when unique is True, you don’t need to specify db_index, because unique implies the creation of an index.
